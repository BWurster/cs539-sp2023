This was the original model that was a deep convolutional neural network.

`OriginalModelTraining.py` was used to train the model and 
`OriginalModelTesting.py` was used to test the accuracy of the model against the 
test set. While this achieved great accuracy, it was not generalizable to
different people with different hands and complex backgrounds.
