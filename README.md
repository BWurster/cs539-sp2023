# CS 539 Sign Language Classifier and Typing Program

This is a repository for a *COMP SCI 539: Introduction to Neural Networks* 
end-of-the-semester class project. Over the course of the semester, we touched 
on a variety of topics, including concepts present in this project such as 
classification, neural networks, and transfer learning.

For many in the group, this was the first time using git and GitHub. As a 
result, the repository is not super organized. However, we have done our best to
make the code we have created easy to explore and play with.

There were 3 stages of our model development, each of which improved on aspects
of the prior.
