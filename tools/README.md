These are some tools that were used to assist development.

`ImageGenerator.py` was used to add images to our datasets to try to make our
neural network more generalized to various bacgrounds and hand positions.

`PictureGetter.ipynb` was used to take single images and provide data analytics 
on the prediction to provide some insight for where the model is going wrong.

**NOTE:** These programs are not ready to run within this repo as is. They would
require some tinkering and modification to make work, as they were put into the 
tools folder after-the-fact.
